ASIDE: A Symplectic Integrator Demanded (by) Eugene
Josiah Schwab (jwschwab@berkeley.edu)

This is a side project I played with during Planetary Dynamics (Fall '11).
It's a rather naive implemenation of the Wisdom-Holman map for the 
restricted three body problem. 

src/ 
  The code, written in Fortran 95 (ish), lives here.
  Typing 'make' will compile it with gfortran.

exe/
  The executable file aside.x is placed here. 
  At runtime, it reads aside.in. (see input.f95 for details)
  The output goes into aside.out. (see output.f95 for details)
  There is an example input, aside.in.example.

plot/
  This contains plotting scripts in the Tioga language.
  See most quanties with 'tioga plot_aside.rb -s orbel'.
  
  example_data/
    The output of running ASIDE and SWIFTER on the initial conditinons
    defined in aside.in.example. 

  plots_out/
    example.pdf is a comparison of the results of ASIDE and SWIFTER.
