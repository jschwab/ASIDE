ASIDE: A Symplectic Integrator Demanded (by) Eugene
Josiah Schwab (jwschwab@berkeley.edu)

This is a side project I played with during Planetary Dynamics (Fall '11).
It's a rather naive implemenation of the Wisdom-Holman map for the 
restricted three body problem. 

/src/ 
  The code, written in Fortran 95 (ish), lives here.
  Typing 'make' will compile it with gfortran.

/exe/
  The executable file aside.x is placed here. 
  At runtime, it reads aside.in. (see input.f95 for details)
  The output goes into aside.out. (see output.f95 for details)

/plot/
  This contains plotting scripts in the Tioga language.
  See most quanties with 'tioga plot_aside.rb -s orbel'.
